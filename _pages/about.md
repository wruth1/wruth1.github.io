I am a postoctoral fellow working on biostatistics with Prof. Bouchra Nasri at the Université de Montréal (working remotely from BC). My research areas include epidemic modelling and analysis, particularly of COVID-19, using stochastic simulation and missing data methodology. I am also interested in multilevel GLMs, particularly as they apply to causal mediation analysis.
