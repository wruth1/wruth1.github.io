I am a postdoctoral fellow working on biostatistics with Prof. Bouchra Nasri at the Université de Montréal (remotely from BC). My main research areas include causal mediation analysis and adaptive Monte Carlo methods. I also work on modelling the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and tuberculosis.
